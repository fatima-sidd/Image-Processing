# Image-Processing
This is a console based project implemented in C++ language. It was a project for the course Programming Fundamentals. 
This project was inspired from the application 'Irfan View' and can be used to edit '.pgm' files
This Provides the following functionalities:
**Save** This functionality saves an edited version of .pgm file with a name provided by the user
**Load** This functionality loads a file in order to edit it. The name of the file has to be given by the user in order to load it

**Combine Top to Bottom ** This functionality uses two files and combines them top to bottom, and fills the rest of the area by a fill color

**Medianter** This functionality replacwa each pixel value in an image with the median value of its neighbors, including itself. This has the effect of eliminating pixel values which are unrepresentative of their surroundings.
**Resize** This functionality either resizes the file into a given number of rows or columns, or into a given ratio
**Quantize ** This functionality takes a number to quantize the file into
**Rotate ** This functionality rotates a file left or right
**Transform ** This functionality transforms a file
**Crop** This functionality crops the file into given number of rows and columns
**Filter** This functionality applied a filter to the file
**Derivative** This functionality computes the derivative of the file
